This is the early version of a project i worked on.

This is a 2D dungeon crawler game about a wizard, Michael Kockus trying to retake the kingdom from the dark wizard.
The player can move with WASD controls and shoot with the arrow keys. They can also switch between spell types with Q and E.

Spells have different effects
Fire: leaves burning damage on opponents
Lightning: partial damage jumps to a nearby enemy
Ice: Slows enemies
Magic Missle: no special effect, enemies cannot be immune to this spell
Enemies with the same color orb above their heads are imune to that particular spell.

Hold spacebar to activate a shield protecting you from projectiles

Spells and shield require mana which recharges.

There are upgrades scattered around each level which will boost your character (damageUp, healthUp, heal, etc.)

There are four levels as of right now and a boss level.
